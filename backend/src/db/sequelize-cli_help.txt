#Seeding the db:
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all           #executes "up" in all your seed files
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo:all      #executes "down" in all your seed files and removes the seed data from the db
npx sequelize-cli db:seed --seed <seed-file-name> #executing a particular seeding file

#Connecting to the DB to query
Once you've logged into the terminal of a running container, you can execute:

- docker exec -it react-intro-db-1 psql -U myuser mydatabase

This allows one to query the DB with SQL commands: SELECT * FROM "Users";
